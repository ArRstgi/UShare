# UShare: A Community Skill-Sharing Platform (Group 17) 

Project Description
- Problem: Learning new skills is hard and it’s even harder to try and self-motivate yourself with online learning. It can be lonely and expensive.
- Solution: A web app that connects people locally for skill-sharing. For example, “I’ll teach you coding, and you teach me how to sing”
- Key Features: User profiles with skills and interests; Matching system for learners & teachers; Chat and scheduling tools; Rating & review system; Login page
- Why This Project?: This application will make it so much easier for people to learn the skills that they’ve been procrastinating for a long time. This will benefit everyone and no one will go unrewarded.
